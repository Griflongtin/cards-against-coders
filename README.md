# Cards Against Coders

##### Epicodus Intro Team Project

## Description

_This game is similar to Cards Against Humanity with a coding spin. A round of play involves a black card with an unfinished phrase whereby players select funny, silly or random answers to fill in the blanks. One player subjectively judges which card is the winner and point goes to that player. Get to know your fellow players and what answers they choose in order to win!_
